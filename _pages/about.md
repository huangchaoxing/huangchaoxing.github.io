Hi, I am Chaoxing. I am a PhD student at the  Department of Imaging and Interventional Radiology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. My currrent research is on the application of deep learning in MRI quantification.    
I obtained my master degree in machine learning and computer vision from the Australian National University, Canberra, in 2020 . In 2018, I earned my Bsc degree in photonic from South China Normal University, Guangzhou. After graduation from ANU,  I was a visiting RA for research intern at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences at Beijing.
