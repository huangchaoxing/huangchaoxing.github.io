Deep eye-part segmentation can overfit easily since large
scale and precise annotated dataset is not always available. One might
question if we can provide real world concept based semantic knowledge
to our model to aid the segmentation learning. We present
our research progress on using batch-based deep feature factorization to
provide concept oriented ground-truth for model pre-training in eye-part
segmentation. We examine our method on the CASIA-distance dataset
and the results initially demonstrate the effectiveness. Further work on
using different datasets and adopting a more 
exible factorization tech-
nique are required.
