Event camera is an asynchronous, high frequency vision sensor
with low power consumption, which is suitable for human
action recognition task. It is vital to encode the spatialtemporal
information of event data properly and use standard
computer vision tool to learn from the data. In this work,
we propose a timestamp image encoding 2D network, which
takes the encoded spatial-temporal images of the event data
as input and output the action label. Experiment results show
that our method can achieve the same level of performance as
those RGB-based benchmarks on real world action recognition,
and also achieve the SOTA result on gesture recognition.
