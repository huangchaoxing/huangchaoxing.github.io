Hi, I am Chaoxing. I am a PhD student at the  CUHK Lab of AI in Radiology (CLAIR), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, expected to graduate in 2025 . My currrent research is on the application of deep learning in quantitative MRI (qMRI). 

  
 **<span style="color:red"> I am actively looking for research position in both industry and academia (detailed CV), feel free to drop me an email. </span>**
