Hi, I am Chaoxing Huang. I am a PhD graduate from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I did my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://https://www.diir.cuhk.edu.hk/staff/weitian-chen/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: solid;"> Weitian Chen </a> at CUHK Lab of AI in Radiology(<a href="https://www.diir.cuhk.edu.hk/research/artificial-intelligence/" style="color: blue; text-decoration-style: solid;"> CLIAR </a> ). My PhD research was in deep learning and medical imaging, with particular focus on the application of deep learning in quantitative MRI (qMRI).
